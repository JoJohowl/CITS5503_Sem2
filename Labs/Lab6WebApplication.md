## Learning Objectives

1. Create a web app using Django
2. Implement nginx and load balance requests to it
3. Retrieve data from DynamoDB to display in the app

## Technologies Covered

* Ubuntu
* AWS
* AWS ELB
* RDS
* Python/Boto scripts

Note: please use your Linux VM – if you do it from any other OS (e.g., Windows, Mac – some unknow issues might occur)

## Background

The aim of this lab is to write a program that will:

[1] Understand the basis for a web architecture that incorporates scalability and security using ELB
[2] Familiarise yourself with the basics of programming using Django

## EC2 instance

### [Step 1] Create an EC2 instance

[1] Create an EC2 micro instance using Ubuntu and SSH into it. Install the Python 3 virtual environment package. 

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```
It is easier now if you change the bash to operate as sudo

```
sudo bash
```

[2] Create a directory with a path /opt/wwc/mysites and cd into that.  Set up a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

[3] Activate your virtual environment and then:

```
source myvenv/bin/activate


pip install django

django-admin startproject lab

cd lab

python3 manage.py startapp polls
```

Stop and look at the files that have been created – the project files are to do with the running of the application. We will deal with the files as we go through.


### [Step 2] Install and configure nginx

[1] install nginx

```
apt install nginx
```

edit /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default and replace the contents of the file with

```
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  location / {
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
  }
}
```

[2] Once you have done this you can restart nginx

```
service nginx restart
```

[3] in your app directory: /opt/wwc/mysites/lab you can run

```
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

[4] Open a browser and enter the ip address of your ec2 instance, take a screenshot of what you see and stop your server with CONTROL-C


### [Step 3] Change the code

[1] Following the steps outlined in the lecture, edit the following files (create the file if it does not exist)

edit polls/views.py

```
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world.")
```

edit polls/urls.py 

```
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

edit lab/urls.py

```
from django.urls import include, path
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

[2] now run

```
python3 manage.py runserver 8000
```

[3] Type the url http://\<ip address of your EC2 instance>/polls/, check that you get "Hello, world." 

NOTE remember to put the /polls/ on the end and you may need to restart nginx if it does not work.

### [Step 4] Add an application load balancer (customize your ALB from the last lab)

[1] Create an application load balancer, specify the region subnet where your EC2 instance resides, create a listener with a default rule Protocol: HTTP and Port 80 forwarding.

[2] Choose the security group, allowing HTTP traffic.

[3] For the target group, in the health check, specify /polls/ for the path.

[4] Add your instance as a registered target.

Once you have created the ALB, you should see the health check fetch the /polls/ page every 30 seconds

You can now access the site using the url http://\<load balancer dns name>/polls/


### [Optional] Web interface for CloudStorage application

You need to create an AWS DynamoDB table copied from the local DynamoDB of the previous lab3 as well as a copy of your AWS credentials.

In views.py, add boto3 code to scan the AWS DynamoDB table. Display the results in the calling page.

In Django, you can use a template to properly format a web page using supplied variables – you can do that to make the table look nice. To use a template, you need to create a folder called templates under polls and add to the TEMPLATES section of lab/settings.py

```
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [
            'polls/templates/'
        ],
```

In the templates directory, add a file files.html with the following contents:

```
<html>
<head>
    <title>Files</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Files </h1>


    <ul>
        {% for item in items %}
          <li>{{ item.fileName }}</li>
	{% endfor %}
    </ul>

</body>
</html>
```


Finally in views.py, you can pass variables from your DynamoDB call and render the template in the following way:

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.template import loader
from django.http import HttpResponse
import boto3
import json
from boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Key, Attr
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def index(request):
    template = loader.get_template('files.html')

    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name='ap-southeast-2',
                              aws_access_key_id='Your Access Key',
                              aws_secret_access_key='Your Secret')

    table = dynamodb.Table("UserFiles")

    items = []
    try:
        response = table.scan()

    except ClientError as e:
        print(e.response['Error']['Message'])
    else:    
        context = {'items': response['Items'] }

        return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
```


You can add variables to the template and more formatting to display the information correctly.
